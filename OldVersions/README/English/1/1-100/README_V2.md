The following content is stripped out of B builds:

> Video files

> Video project files

> Many image files

> Audio files

> Audio project files

> Extra program files (Python, Audacity)

***

## Audio

With this project, an album of 11 audio files is included in WAV format.

Here is the tracklist:

01 CDVDRAYCheck .wav
02 Chord.wav
03 Connecting to receiver.wav
04 Dead Chirp .wav
05 Exclamation .wav
06 Floppy check.wav

The total running time is 154 seconds (2 minutes and 34 seconds)

## Other MEDOS projects

> This version of MEDOS is designed to be run on a tape drive.

***

## MEDOS commercial

The MEDOS commercial was an old project within this project for a commercial for the product.

The commercial uses audio files of Stephen Hawking [generated by Lingojam](https://lingojam.com/StephenHawkingVoiceGenerator) and talks about the future of [dos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) over old operating systems and [286 computers (NON HTTPS LINK WARNING)](http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/userdata/images/large/56/32/product-75632.jpg). The commercial is outdated.

***

## Spelling errors

This project has a few spelling errors that I cloned to GitHub. I didn't fix these, as they were originally like that in the original project, and I can't change it at all, as I want to have a complete archive with no differences (other than things added, or files I can't upload)

The only word that was misspelled in a folder/file name is Armenian (spelled as `Armanian`)

***

## Included programs

This project includes 2 third party, free and open source programs, for the Windows, MacOS, and Linux architectures, so you don't have to get them yourself. The included programs are:
